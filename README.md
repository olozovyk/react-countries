# React Countries

This is a single page application created on React with TypeScript.

Main idea of the application is interaction with an external API, in this case
with [REST Countries](https://restcountries.com/), and providing data to users -
information about countries, capitals, populations, currencies, etc.

Redux is used for working with state and RTQ Query for fetching data.

The app is styled using [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction).

The project consists of 2 pages - MainPage with a list of countries and
DetailPage with detailed information about a particular country. For routing
[React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) is used.
